# Basic Project
This project is very fundamental, which mainly contains some common tools for specific usage.

For example, you can call the functions in this project to easily save '.pkl' data and load '.pkl' data. And you can also optimize the data's type of pandas DataFrame to decrease the memory usage. What's more, you can traverse one directory to get all the files (maybe picture, text, etc.) inside.

In the future, there would be more and more tools to be added in this project. This project is implemented by python3, and it's only for study.
